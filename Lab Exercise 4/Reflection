In this exercise, I focused on enhancing my debugging and problem-solving skills by addressing various programming challenges
For Question 2, I focused on developing functions to calculate averages and identify the brand with the lowest sales percentage. 
Task 2 helped me solidify my understanding of structures and how to manage multi-year data by calculating the average sales percentage. 
In Task 3, I worked on identifying the brand with the lowest sales average, which improved my ability to process arrays and make decisions based on data. 
These tasks enhanced my ability to apply C++ structures and functions to real-world scenarios, focusing on data analysis and efficient problem-solving.
