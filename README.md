PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE I
As a fundamental subject, this course equips the students with theory and practice on problem solving techniques by using the structured approach. 
Students are required to develop programs using C++ programming language, in order to solve simple to moderate problems. 
The course covers the following: preprocessor directives, constants and variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures: sequential, selection and loop, built-in and user-defined functions, single- and two-dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data types.
