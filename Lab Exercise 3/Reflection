In this programming exercise, I got hands-on experience using functions to modularize the code and improve readability. 
In Question 1, I created a function isPassing to evaluate the students test score, making the code cleaner and easier to understand. 
For other exercises, I worked with arrays and matrices to process and manipulate data, which helped solidify my understanding of data structures. 
Functions like totalSales and findMaxRegion in Question 4 allowed me to interact with arrays efficiently and pass data by reference to modify values outside the function. 
The exercises also enhanced my ability to calculate totals, averages, and maximum values, and present the results in a user-friendly format. 
Overall, these tasks strengthened my skills in handling user inputs, performing calculations, and organizing code logically using functions and arrays.
