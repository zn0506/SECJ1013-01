Reflection on Programming Techniques Assignment 1

In this assignment, I explored fundamental programming concepts, including branching (if..else), looping (repeat..until or do..while), and user-defined functions. 
Designing the solution using flowcharts was an insightful experience, as it helped me visually structure the problem-solving process. 
By creating flowcharts with tools like draw.io, I developed a deeper understanding of how decision-making and iteration are implemented in algorithms. 
The branching structures clarified the conditional paths, while the looping structures demonstrated repetitive processes effectively. Furthermore, designing and integrating a user-defined function flowchart emphasized the importance of modular programming and parameter usage, promoting code reusability and clarity.
This exercise not only reinforced my knowledge of these programming techniques but also enhanced my ability to think systematically and translate abstract problem statements into concrete, visual solutions. 
Overall, it was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my problem-solving and design skills.
